This repo is all about analyzing and predicting sales data. It features Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts to explore historical data, evaluate models, and visualize results.

## Key Components

- **Data Processing:** Aggregates and preprocesses sales logs.
- **Forecasting Models:** Implements simple models like naive forecasting.
- **Performance Metrics:** Uses RMSE and MAPE to assess model effectiveness.
- **Visualizations:** Plots sales trends and predictions.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn

## Quick Start

1. Make sure Python 3 and required packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn
   ```
2. Place `PotLog.csv` in your working directory.
3. Run `SalesForcasting.ipynb` for an interactive analysis or execute `salesforecasting.py` for the model.

### Gotchas

Use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.
